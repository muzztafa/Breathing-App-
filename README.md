# Breathing-App-

Hey there.

It's a simple breathing app that I made for a client on fiverr.com. It uses animations and a simple gui.

It's breathing patterns are customizable but the initial presets are: 4-5-4 (Breath in, Hold, Breath out) respectively. Everything is customizable however.

It has two themes (Dark and Light). You can select between the two in the settings tab. (Swipe left on the completed screen or press the Settings icon on the front screen)

The entire app runs on different count down timers: Simple, but highly effective.

Thanks!
